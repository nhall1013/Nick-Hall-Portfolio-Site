            The focus for this project was an introduction to manipulating the DOM with the DOM API for JavaScript. I was also practicing using the MVC design pattern. This was a challenging project because of my in experience with building apps from the ground up with JavaScript. JavaScript's syntax is very similar to Java, which is my primary programming language, so I didn't have an issue with that aspect of this project. However, I did find that using the MVC design pattern was a challenge at first. As the project progressed I started to get the hang of it though. The next challenge that I faced was using the local storage API. I'm still trying to figure this API out and I think it's going to take some time before I feel comfortable with it.

            The Expense Tracker gets budget input from the user. When the user clicks the enter button it updates the budget value on the right. Next, it gets expense information from the user in the form of an expense name and an expense value. Once the user clicks the enter button it updates the expense value on the right and an ordered list of expenses is displayed underneath the budget and expense values. When the user enters more expense information the app adds the new value to the expense, keeping track of total expenses, and also updates the list of expenses. You can view the program in action below.

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            As you can see from the input I am attempting to calculate the remaining funds after each expense is entered however, I'm getting NaN as an output. This is a bug in the app and I'm working on resolving this.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have plans for future improvements for this app. First I plan on fixing the issue with calculating the remaining funds value as well as the issue I'm having with saving data to local storage using the local storage API. I'm also planning on adding an option to remove items from the list by clicking a delete button next to the list item and then updating the expense and remaining values. I'm planning on adding a feature that gives users feedback and suggestions based on the amount of remaining funds. Finally, I'd like the polish the design more by using Bootstrap and CSS.

            Despite facing some challenges with this project and still working on some bugs, I had a lot of fun building it and it was a great learning experience. I feel more comfortable with JavaScript and the MVC design pattern. I'm looking forward to solving the NaN bug with the remaining values and being able to use the local storage API to store users data permanently. Thanks for reading my post! I hope you enjoyed it!
